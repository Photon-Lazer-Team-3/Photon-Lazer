# Team 3 : Photon-Lazer 
# The programming language being used for this Project is Java.
# The version of Java being used for this Project is 17.0.2
#
# Note: We highly recommend using a Windows computer with a Monitor/Screen Size of 1920-by-1080 to run our code to avoid any issues with the GUI.
# Note: Supabase does not have a shareable access link to view our Database (like Heroku); therefore, the system's user will need to be invited to view our Database. We would like to apologize for the inconvenience.
#
# To run our code, please download the Photon-Lazer.jar File and python_trafficgenerator.py File from our "main" branch to your Windows computer.
#If the jar file is not located on the main branch do not download one from another branch as it may not be in working condition instead download it from the google drive link below.

# Open up a command prompt/terminal that points to the directory where the Photon-Lazer.jar File and python_trafficgenerator.py File are being stored.
# Type in the following line to run our code: java -jar Photon-Lazer.jar
# In a second (or separate) command prompt/terminal, type in "python python_trafficgenerator.py" to start the Python Traffic Generator.
#
# Splash Screen Information:
# The Splash Screen will appear for three (3) seconds, then you will be redirected to the Player Entry Screen. 
# 
# Player Entry Screen Information:
# On the Player Entry Screen, the first column under each Team represents the space for the Players' ID Numbers, and the second column under each Team represents the space for the Players' Code Names. To be able to edit these fields / spaces, please click on the "Edit Game" button. 
# Note: We recommend having at least two (2) Players on both Teams to be able to correctly use the Python Traffic Generator.
#
# If a Player's ID Number exists in our database, then the Player's Code Name space will automatically be filled with their Code Name. If the Player's ID Number does not exist in our database, then you will be able to input a Code Name for this Player, and the Code Name will be saved to our database with the ID Number.
#
# Once you have finished editing the Players on both Teams, then please click on the "Start Game" button.
# This will begin the thirty (30) second Count-down timer on the Player Entry Screen. During these thirty (30) seconds, please navigate to the command prompt/terminal for the Python Traffic Generator, input the Player Code Names for the Red Team Players and Green Team Players, and input the number of events for the Python Traffic Generator to generate (i.e.: 1000).
#
# Play Action Screen Information:
# When the thirty (30) second timer on the Player Entry Screen ends, a new JFrame will open and will show the Play Action Screen. 
# A six (6) minute game timer will begin on the Play Action Screen, and you will hear a random audio file track (from one of eight audio files) being played.
# The Players you inputted for the Red Team and Green Team will appear under the corresponding Team Columns on the left side and right side of the Play Action Screen. 
# The events from the Python Traffic Generator will be printed to the box on the center of the Play Action Screen. When the box containing the events fills up, a Scroll Bar/Pane will appear to allow you to scroll through the different events.
# The Player scores and Cumulative Team scores will be constantly updating based on the events received from the Python Traffic Generator.
# When the six (6) minute game timer ends, the audio file will stop playing, the program will stop receiving data/events from the Python Traffic Generator, and the Player (and Team) scores will stop updating.
